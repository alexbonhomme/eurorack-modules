# Saturator

Analog Eurorack module for soft clipping and tone shaping. Uses LEDs in the feedback path for symmetric soft clipping, followed by a Baxandall-style tone control (bass and treble). No microcontroller — fully analog.

## Features

- LED-based soft clipping (symmetric saturation)
- Baxandall tone control stage for bass/treble adjustment
- Eurorack-level input and output; standard ±12V power
